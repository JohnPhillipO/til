> 📝 Today I Learned (Inspo: @jbranchaud)

A collection of concise **markdown** notes on things I learn day by day. These notes consist of a variety of coding languages I've learned or currently learning and hobbies outside of software development journey.

The purpose of this GitHub reponsitory is in the case I forget something that I know I've learned before. Instead of going through various of sources I can come into this repository and search for what notes I need.
